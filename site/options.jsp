Cardmaster Conflict has been compiled against both Java 1.5 and Java 1.4. <Br>
The Java 1.5 Version has enhanced image caching and preloading, enhanced speed, and is reccomended for most modern systems using the latest version of java.  If you have Java 1.5, this is the mode you should be using: it will be faster, more responsive, and less laggy when it comes to loading images.<br>
The Java 1.4 Version however, lacks the new preloading system, and is being offered for low-end systems with slow internet connections that have problems with Java 1.5.  This is rare, but in the interest of not letting people behind I am providing the option to switch to 1.4.  This version will not be updated as often as the 1.5 version -only for major bugs and updates.  If Java 1.5 takes too long to load, or times out too easy, uninstall Java 1.5 and set this option.  NOTE: It is not reccomended to use the 1.4 version when you are running 1.5.<br><br>

Set my Java Version to: <a href="page.jsp?pageurl=SetJavaVersion.jsp&ver=15">Java 1.5 (Default)</a> | <a href="page.jsp?pageurl=SetJavaVersion.jsp&ver=14">Java 1.4</a><br>

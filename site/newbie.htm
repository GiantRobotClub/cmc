<BODY><BR><B>NEWBIES' GUIDE TO DECKBUILDING</B><BR><B>And Other Useful Tips</B> 
<BR>If you're reading this, then you're probably new to the game and looking for 
advice. Once again, you've come to the right place.<BR><BR>First of all, let's 
look with what you started with. You have 1 starter deck and 1000 points. The 
first thing you should do is buy a booster. You'll need it. I reccomend renaming 
the booster to "Extras" or such. Some people keep an extra deck for each color 
of extra cards, but that's really unimportant. <BR><BR>What is important is 
thinning out your deck. The general guideline is 30-45 cards. Less than that 
means you are too vulnerable to decking if you lose too many of your important 
cards. More than that means you can not reliably draw your important cards and 
have to overcompensate with mana to ensure you get that.<BR><BR>Remember, we're 
going to be adding some of the cards from the booster into the deck. Start 
adding the cards of your chosen color that fit the deck well. Now, you want to 
add "Splash". Splash is where you put in off-color cards so you can spend all 
the off-color mana you've been accumulating over the turns. Depending on the 
cost of the cards and personal taste (not to mention deck size), you want 4 to 8 
cards splashed in. I recommend cards like NPC, Slime Valley, Kelar Tremorcall, 
Goblin, Smash Hopes, Pacificism, Might Makes Wrong, or Touch of Knowledge. There 
are many other good cards, depending on how you build your deck.<BR><BR>Finally, 
there's mana. You have sac'able mana (skulls, buckets, and orbs), generators 
(shrines, obelisks, charms), and instant mana (kelar dances, sunflares, dark 
rituals). Be careful not to put too much splash in if you're playing more than a 
few instant mana cards. Anyway, you want about a third of your deck to be mana 
cards; how much of each one is up to you.<BR><BR>Another good source of mana is 
creature generators (slime valley, fairy forest, gremlin pit). These cards not 
only have a high sac value, but they also produce a creature every turn that can 
be immediately sac'ed for mana (or saved to help defend yourself). These are 
very nice for catching up on mana when you need it, but you don't want to count 
them in your 1/3 of the deck count. They just cost too much to be reliable basic 
mana.<BR><BR><B>Some Tips for Playing</B><BR><BR>If you have a creature 
generator, try to use it every turn. At the very least, you can create a 
creature and then sac it for mana.<BR>If a creature is too hurt to be of use, 
remember that you can sacrifice it for mana.<BR>Always try to carry some 
effect-destruction cards. Many decks don't have any good effects, but the ones 
that do can be very challenging.<BR>Remember to use ability cards during your 
opponent's attack resolution.<BR>If you want to cancel a spell or ability, click 
on an invalid target; but be sure it's invalid.<BR>If you keep drawing a card 
and thinking it's useless (for being too weak OR too expensive) it's a good sign 
you should remove it from your deck.<BR>Remember that you can save up spells 
until you need them; if you have a kerpow in your hand, you can kill your 
opponent when his life reaches 50. If you do it early, your opponent might play 
too defensively.<BR>If you want to know what cards are good, look in the <A 
href="http://forum.cmc.redleaf.de/index.php?c=4">forum</A>. If people are 
complaining alot about a card, it probably means it's a good card to put in your 
deck. <BR><BR><BR>The rest of the rules are <A

luck!</B><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-HailSpork</BODY></HTML>

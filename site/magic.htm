<BODY><BR><B>QUICK-START FOR MAGIC PLAYERS</B><BR><BR>If you're here, then you 
used to play Magic and you want to play Cardmaster Conflict without wasting alot 
of time reading the rules. You're in luck, that's what this guide is for. It 
won't tell you all the rules, but it will be short, sweet and to the 
point.<BR><BR><B>The Similarities</B><BR>So here's what you're used to. You need 
to get mana to be able to afford the cards in your hand. If you deal enough 
damage to your opponent or if your opponent draws from an empty deck, you 
win.<BR>Instead of summons, you have <A 
href="page.jsp?pageurl=instructions.html#4_1">Monsters</A>.<BR>Instead 
of enchantments and artifacts, you have <A 
href="page.jsp?pageurl=instructions.html#4_2">Effects</A>.<BR>Instead 
of instants, you have <A 
href="page.jsp?pageurl=instructions.html#4_3">Spells</A>.<BR>Instead 
of tapping, you have <A 
href="page.jsp?pageurl=instructions.html#dizzy">Dizzying</A>.<BR><BR><B>The 
Differences</B><BR>First of all, there are no lands, sorceries, interrupts, mana 
sources, or equivalences.There are only Spells, Monsters, and Effects. <BR>Next, 
things are cumulative; that means that mana builds up from turn to turn. Also, 
it means that creatures do <B>not</B> automatically heal at the end of the turn. 
<BR>There are three colors, not five.<BR>The damage scale is hugely 
increased.<BR>You get 1 mana of each color at the beginning of your turn.<BR>You 
are limited to five effects and five monsters.<BR>You can sacrifice almost any 
card for mana.<BR><B>All</B> monsters have trample, but trample damage is 
halved.<BR>You can directly attack a monster, but then there is no 
overflow/trample damage.<BR>Instead of a First-In/Last-Out stack, CMC uses a 
system called "Clickwar".<BR>You buy cards with points, not money.<BR><BR>And 
best of all..... It's completely <B>FREE</B> to play.<BR>If you want to support 
webrunner, you can donate <A 
href="page.jsp?pageurl=helpout.jsp">here</A>, and get 
extra points and a promo card.<BR><BR>The rest of the rules are <A 
href="page.jsp?pageurl=instructions.html">here</A>.<BR><BR><B>Good 
luck!</B><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-HailSpork</BODY></HTML>

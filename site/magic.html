QUICK-START FOR MAGIC PLAYERS</b><br>
<br>
If you're here, then you used to play Magic and you want to play Cardmaster Conflict without wasting alot of time reading the rules.  You're in luck, that's what this guide is for.  It won't tell you all the rules, but it will be short, sweet and to the point.<br><br>

<b>The Similarities</b><br>
So here's what you're used to.  You need to get mana to be able to afford the cards in your hand.  If you deal enough damage to your opponent or if your opponent draws from an empty deck, you win.<br>
Instead of summons, you have <a href="instructions.html#4_1">Monsters</a>.<br>
Instead of enchantments and artifacts, you have <a href="instructions.html#4_2">Effects</a>.<br>
Instead of instants, you have <a href="instructions.html#4_3">Spells</a>.<br>
Instead of tapping, you have <a href="instructions.html#dizzy">Dizzying</a>.<br>
<br>

<b>The Differences</b><br>
First of all, there are no lands, sorceries, interrupts, mana sources, or equivalences.There are only Spells, Monsters, and Effects.  <br>
Next, things are cumulative; that means that mana builds up from turn to turn.  Also, it means that creatures do <b>not</b> automatically heal at the end of the turn.  <br>
There are three colors, not five.<br>
The damage scale is hugely increased.<br>
You get 1 mana of each color at the beginning of your turn.<br>
You are limited to five effects and five monsters.<br>
You can sacrifice almost any card for mana.<br>
<b>All</b> monsters have trample, but trample damage is halved.<br>
You can directly attack a monster, but then there is no overflow/trample damage.<br>
Instead of a First-In/Last-Out stack, CMC uses a system called "Clickwar".<br>
You buy cards with points, not money.<br><br>
And best of all.....  It's completely <b>FREE</b> to play.<br>
If you want to support webrunner, you can donate <a href="page.jsp?pageurl=helpout.jsp">here</a>, and get extra points and a promo card.<br><br>

<b>Good luck!</b><br><br>

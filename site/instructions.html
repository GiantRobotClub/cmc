<span id=1_0>

<B>1. Introduction</B> by Webrunner<BR>
</span>
<BR>Cardmasters Conflict is a 
Java-based Collectable Card Game. The game is designed to <BR>automate every 
aspect not requiring user choice. Cards have special effects, <BR>rarity, and 
everything you would expect out of your average physical card game. <BR>All 
commands are done through the bot. This guide explains how to play the 
game.<BR><BR><B>

2. <span id=2_0>Getting Started</span><BR></B>For those of you who have 
played Magic, there is a quick-start guide <A 
href="page.jsp?pageurl=magic.html">here</A>.<BR>

<BR>Alright, the first 
thing you need to do is pick up a starter deck from <A 
href="page.jsp?pageurl=create.html">here</A>. Just 
follow the instructions, including an email confirmation.<BR>You have your 
choice of three pre-built starter decks, one for each color. Each one is about 
50 cards with a nice spread of mana, commons, uncommons, and even a few rares. 
If you can't decide which deck to start with, just remember that you can find 
all the cards in booster packs or even purchase extra starter decks.<BR>Your new 
account will not only come with a starter deck, but also 1000 points to 
spend.<BR><BR><B>

2.2. <span id=2_2>The Chat Room</span>

<BR></B>When you log in and 
click on the "Play CMC Now" button, you will be taken to the chat room, or 
Matchmaker.  This allows you to chat with other users, play with other users, 
and trade with other users.  At the top are four buttons, which switch your mode. 
The four modes are Play which allows you to challenge other users in Play, Trade 
which allows you to trade with other users in that mode, Chat and Away - both in 
which you cannot play or trade.<BR><br>
Each player's box includes their Avatar (see section on avatars), their wins and 
losses, their mode icon, and other miscelannious icons.<br><br>
If you want to challenge a user, make sure that you are in the same mode (The OK! icon should indicate 
this) and then click on their info box.  If they then click on your info box, the game will automatically
start.


<BR>Chat Room Icons: These are the icons that appear in the Matchmaker:<br>
<img src="images\chatmode_0.gif"> - User is in Play mode.<br>
<img src="images\chatmode_1.gif"> - User is in Trade mode.<br>
<img src="images\chatmode_2.gif"> - User is in Chat mode.<br>
<img src="images\chatmode_3.gif"> - User is in Away mode.<br>
<img src="images\chatok.gif"> - User can be challenged to Trade or Play.<br>
<img src="images\chat_admin.gif"> - User is an Administrator<br>
<img src="images\chat_donor.gif"> - User Donated to Cardmaster Conflict<br>
<img src="images\chatmode_0.gif"> - User is in Play mode.<br>
<img src="images\chat_trophy.gif"> - User has won a Tournament.  More trophies mean more wins.<br>


<BR><BR><B>

3. <span id=3_0>Decks and Points</span>

<BR></B>


All of the cards you own will be held in 
decks. Every time you buy a booster or trade, you will generate a new deck. All 
decks have span id and a number. The name is what you call it, the number is how 
the CMC program indexes it. The name shows up in the deck management screen and 
will also be announced when you first start a game.<BR><BR><B>
</span>
3.1. <span id=3_1>Deck Management</span> <BR></B>To manage your decks, click on the "Modify 
your decks" button. You will receive a few choices.<BR>

<BR><U>View Deck</U>: 
This will show you the contents of your deck. Here, you can see detailed 
information about each card, including the rarity and sell value. You can also 
sell your cards here for the amount listed. At the top is also a "Sell Entire 
Deck" command. At the bottom is the deck size. Any cards sold will go to the 
Singles Shop, where anybody can buy them at approximately three times what you 
sold them for.<BR>

<BR><U>Set Primary Deck</U>: Although you may have 20 decks, 
you can only play with one at a time. This is your primary deck and will be 
marked as such. To change your primary deck, choose the new deck you want to 
play with and click "Switch Deck".<BR>

<BR><U>Move Cards</U>: This is similar to 
the View Deck command except that you also have the option of moving cards from 
one deck to another. You can still sell both individual cards and entire decks 
from this screen. Once you've clicked on a card to move, you can move more of 
the same by hitting the refresh button, or hit the back button to see the source 
deck again.<BR>

<BR><U>Move Entire Deck</U>: Moves all cards from the first deck 
to the second Deck and deletes the first deck. Be sure that you don't select the 
same deck as first and second... bad things happen.<BR><BR><U>Set Deck Name</U>: 
For ease of keeping track of your decks, you can give them names. The names only 
appear in the deck management screen and in an announcement before each game.<br>

<BR><U>Voucher Codes</u>: As stated, if you find a word beginning with VCH anywhere in CMC, <a href="http://www.adventurers-comic.com/">Adventurers!</a>, <a href="http://www.antiheroforhire.com">Antihero for Hire</a>, or anywhere else webrunner has influence, you can type that code in here to get bonus cards.  You can only do that once per code.<br>



<BR><U>Create Empty Deck</U>: Again, does exactly what you'd expect. 
The new deck is named "Generic Deck".<BR>

<BR><U>Player Profile Options</u>: Here you can set your own profile and view the profiles of other people.  The awards next to the image are based on your account.  This is fairly self-explanatory.<br>

<BR><B>3.2. <span id=3_2>Points</span> <BR></B>The currency of Cardmaster 
Conflict is points. There are four ways to get points: winning, losing, selling 
cards, and trading. You can spend points on starters, boosters, singles, and in 
trading.<BR><BR>
Whenever you win a game, you get a number of points equal to:<BR>
200 + (Opponent's Wins) + (Opponent's Losses)/5<BR>
To a maximum of 400 points.<BR>
When you lose, you gain about half the points:<BR>
50 + (Opponent's Wins)/2 + (Opponent's Losses)/10<BR>
To a maximum of 200 points.<BR><BR>
Booster packs hold 15 cards; 9 commons (rarity 1-60), 5 uncommons (rarity 61-85), and 1 
rare (rarity 86-100). Each booster costs 800 points.<BR>The starters are the 
same as when you first signed up. Each one costs 3000 points.<BR>
To buy singles, select a deck and browse the selection.<BR><BR><B>

3.3. <span id=3_3>Trading </span>
<BR></B>To begin trading, first go to the chat room. Now click on "Switch to 
Trading Mode". Now, challenge another another trader. Once the person challenges 
you back, you will both go to the trading room.<BR><BR>The trade screen is as 
follows:<BR><IMG src="images/trading.gif"> <BR><BR>
1: These are the cards your opponent is offering you. <BR>
2: These are the cards you are offering your opponent. <BR>
3: These are the cards in your current deck. <BR>
4: Your opponent information. <BR>
5: This is the amount of points your opponent is offering you. <BR>
6: Your information. <BR>
7: This is the amount of points you are offering your opponent. <BR>
8: Your point control. This lets you adjust the amount of points you're offering. <BR>
9: This displays your current deck number and lets you select other decks. <BR>
10: This enlarges the currently selected card so you can see more detail. <BR>
11: Chat. <BR>

<BR>If you want to add a card to your offering, select the appropriate deck, scroll through your deck until 
you find it, and click on it. If you click on a card that you're offering, it 
goes back to its original deck. To add points, type the number of points you 
want to add, and hit the plus button. Hitting the minus button takes points 
away. Once you hit lock, you can not change the cards or points you are 
offering. If you are both locked, you can hit ready. Once you are both locked 
and ready, the cards and points will be exchanged and you will both leave the 
trade room. You will also have a new generic deck containing any cards you would 
have received (or an empty deck if you didn't get any).<BR><BR>Now that you've 
learned the basics, you can pickup some tips for deckbuilding <A 
href="page.jsp?pageurl=newbie.html">here</A>.<BR><BR><B>

4. <span id=4_0>The Cards </span><BR></B>There are five types of cards; monsters, effects, 
spells, modifiers and locations.<BR><IMG src="images/4cards.gif"><BR>

<BR>A breakdown of 
the cards can be seen here:<BR><IMG 
src="images/readcards.gif"><BR>

<BR>The Dizzy indicator will show a 
ring of stars if the card is currently dizzy, a red cross if the card will not undizzy at it's next draw phase like normal, or both if both are true.
<BR>The mana cost shows how 
expensive the card is. It is ordered in Dark mana <img src="images/dmana.gif">, Light mana <img src="images/lmana.gif">, and Grey <img src="images/gmana.gif"> 
mana.<BR>
The sac value shows how much you can get for 
sacrificing the card during your sacrifice phase. Spells do not stay in play and 
do not have a sac value.<BR>
Certain spells and abilities affect different cards depending on their card type.<BR>
The card text will tell you the abilities an effect or monster has, and sometimes has flavor text. Spells will also be 
explained here.<BR>
Expansion set tells you where the card came from. All of the 
cards above are from the CMC Prime set. (<a href="page.jsp?pageurl=exp_list.html">View all expansions</a>)<BR>
Attack and lifepoints are generally only on creatures.  Some effects will have counters as well.<BR>


<BR><B>
4.1. <span id=4_1a>Speed</span><BR></B>
Spells and some monsters and effects will have a speed attribute.  <img src="images/speed_0.gif"> means the ability is instantaneously resolved.  Other cards range from <img src="images/speed_1.gif"> first to <img src="images/speed_5.gif"> last.
If two cards or abilities of the same speed are played, the cards from the active player resolve first.  If there's still a tie, the cards in the tie are resolved in the order they were played.
Aside from cards labeled <img src="images/speed_0.gif">, no spells/abilities are resolved until both players have clicked on the Ability Resolve button.
If a spell/ability no longer has a valid target when it resolves, it fizzles.  You still pay the cost for it, and you lose the spell, but it has no other effect.<br>


<BR><B>
4.2. <span id=4_1>The Monsters</span> <BR></B>
Monsters are the bread and butter of most decks. They are a reusable force that can hurt your 
opponent, hurt other monsters, and protect you from your opponent's 
monsters.<BR>You can put monsters into play during your <A 
href="#5_4">Play phase</A>. They 
generally come into play <A 
href="#dizzy">dizzy</A>, which means 
they can't attack, block, or use any of their creature abilities. Creatures with 
<A href="#speedsummon">speed 
summon</A> do not come into play dizzy.<BR>
Each monster has an attack and life. Attack determines how much damage your monster will inflict on your opponent or 
any monster blocking it. Life determines how much damage your monster can take 
before dying. Monsters do <B>not</B> heal at the end/beginning of the turn 
unless the card specificly says so. Many monsters also have special abilities. 
Some of the more common special abilities can be found <A 
href="#8_0">here</A>, in the 
glossary. Other special abilities will generally be explained on the card 
itself.<BR>To use a special ability, click on the Ability button, then on the 
monster. This can be done at any time. If the ability says <img src="images/abilitypointer.gif"><img src="images/abilitydizzy.gif">, then using 
the ability will dizzy the monster. Sometimes, mana or other costs will appear 
after the <img src="images/abilitypointer.gif">, meaning that each time you use the ability, you must pay that 
cost.<BR>
Monsters with abilities may also have a speed attribute.
You can have up to 5 monsters in play at a time.<BR><BR><B>

4.3. <span id=4_2>The Effects</span> <BR>
</B>Effects are the other kind of reusable card. They 
are played during your play phase, just like monsters. They can not use their 
abilities when they are dizzy, just like monsters. Unlike monsters, they have no 
attack or life and can not fight. Fortunately, this makes them harder to 
destroy.<BR>Unlike monsters, many effects do not come into play dizzy, even 
though they are not marked as having speed summon. To determine if an effect 
comes into play dizzy, you just have to test it out.<BR>
To use a special ability, click on the Ability button, then on the effect This can be done at any 
time. If the ability says <img src="images/abilitypointer.gif"><img src="images/abilitydizzy.gif">, then using the ability will dizzy the effect. 
Sometimes, mana or other costs will appear after the <img src="images/abilitypointer.gif">, meaning that each 
time you use the ability, you must pay that cost.<BR>The most common effects are 
basic mana cards, like Neutral Charms, Mana Buckets, and Dark 
Obelisks.<BR><BR><B>

4.4. <span id=4_3>The Spells </span><BR></B>Unlike effects and 
monsters, spells can be played at any time. Spells that can be cast will be 
highlighted. To cast a spell, just click on the spell, then on the target. All 
spells are described in the text of the card.<BR><BR><B>

4.5. <span id=4_4>Locations</span> <br></b>
Locations are similar to effects, except there is only one location slot, and it is shared by both players.  When a location is played, it automatically replaces the existing location.  Locations affect both players.  Locations can not be sacrificed.<BR><BR><B>
4.6. <span id=4_5>Modifiers</span> <br></b>
Modifier cards are cards played during your play phase on to entities.  They then show up in the "Mod" mode (click "Mods").  They are permanent - the only way to remove a Modifier is to remove the card it's attached to.  Any ability of the modifier is run by the parent- this means that any ability that dizzies as a cost will dizzy the parent, not the modifier.  Modifiers are not entities and cannot be seen or counted or affected by other cards in play.  Allying and Power does, howver, count seperately on a modifier.<BR><BR><B>

5. <span id=5_0>Playing the Game</span> <BR></B>When you first start a game, the CMC program will randomly 
decide who goes first and announce which decks they are playing. Both of you 
will draw 5 cards and get 1 mana of each color. The person who goes first will 
not draw a card during his first draw phase. The person going second will draw a 
card, but will not generate any mana on his first turn. I.E., they both start 
their turn with the same amount of mana, and the second player gets an extra 
card.<BR><BR><B>

5.1. <span id=5_1>The Playing Field</span> <BR></B>Here is what the 
playing field looks like:<BR><IMG src="images/board.gif"><BR><BR>

1: These tabs will let you see the cards in your hand or in your graveyard.<br>
2: These are the cards in your hand.  If the tabs were used, the cards from your graveyard would be here instead.<br>
3: This is your opponent's information.  It is also where you click if you want 
to target your opponent. <BR>
<IMG src="images/handsymbol.gif">: Cards in hand, <IMG src="images/library-full.gif">: Cards in deck, <IMG src="images/graveyard.gif">: Cards in graveryard, <IMG src="images/lifesymbol-healthy.gif">: Life remaining, <IMG src="images/dmana.gif"><IMG src="images/lmana.gif"><IMG src="images/gmana.gif">: Dark mana, Light mana, Grey mana.  Some of these symbols may change as the values change.<br>
4: Whenever a spell is cast or you put your cursor over a card, it will be enlarged here. <BR>
5: This is your information. It is also where you click to target yourself. <BR>
6: This row is where all of your opponent's monsters will be. <BR>
7: This is the row where your opponent's effects will be. <BR>
8: This is the row where your effects will be. <BR>
9: This is the row where your monsters will be. <BR>
10: All the buttons.  Next takes you to the next phase.  Ability lets you use the ability of a monster or effect in play.  Cancel will cancel abilities, reset attackers, and undo the first click on surrender.  Ability Resolve will resolve all spells abilities with a speed other than <IMG src="images/speed_0.gif">. Surrender (when clicked twice) will let you immediately lose the game. Please don't use this if the person is a turn away from winning. Just let them kill you.<br>
11: This is the game events window.  It will display all cards played, phases changed, abilities trying to resolve, the results of combat, and a myriad of other useful pieces of information.<br>
12: This is the chat window.  Enter your own chat below.  There are also some <a href="#7_0">chat commands.</a><br>
13: This is the location slot.  All games begin with a Plains in play.
<BR><BR><B>

5.2. <span id=5_2>The Draw Phase</span> <BR></B>This phase is entirely 
automated. During this phase, you draw a card, gain 1 mana of each color, and 
all of your effects and monsters undizzy. You also gain more mana for any cards 
you have which <A href="#generate">generate</A> mana. 
You also lose mana for any cards with a <A href="#maintenance">maintenance</A>. 
If you have more than 8 cards in your hand, you will be forced to discard down 
to 8.<BR><BR><B>

5.3. <span id=5_3>The Sacrifice Phase</span><BR></B>All monsters and 
effects have a sac value. During your Sacrifice phase, you can double click on 
any monster or effect you control. This will give you mana equal to the sac 
value of that card, but will also destroy that card.<BR><BR><B>

5.4. <span id=5_4>The Play Phase</span> <BR></B>During this phase, you can play monsters and 
effects. Any monsters or effects that you can afford to cast will be 
highlighted. Just click on the card you want to cast, and then on the open slot 
you want to cast it to. Monsters go in the bottom row, and effects go into the 
row above it. Most monsters and a few effects come into play <A 
href="#dizzy">dizzy</A> and can not 
block, attack, or use any abilities.<BR><BR>To use the ability of an undizzy 
monster or effect, click on the Ability button, then on the monster or effect 
you want to use. To cast a spell, just click on the spell card in your hand. 
Both abilities and spells can be done at any time (this just seemed a good place 
to reiterate their use).<BR><BR><B>

5.5. <span id=5_5>The Attack Phase</span><BR></B>To 
attack, click on the undizzy monster you want to attack with, then either click 
on your opponent or a monster. Repeat until you have assigned all the attackers 
you want. Remember, you can change the target of each of your monster's attacks, 
but there is currently no way to cancel attacking. You can only have one monster 
block any attacker, and monsters can only block one attacker.<BR><BR><B>

5.6. <span id=5_6>The Defense Phase</span> <BR></B>This phase only happens if your opponent 
declared any attackers. During the Defense phase of your opponent's turn, you 
are in control of the phase, meaning that the phase ends when you are 
ready.<BR><BR>If your opponent has directly attacked one of your monsters (by 
choosing your monster as the target of his attack), then both monsters will be 
highlighted in the same color. A monster being directly attacked must block that 
attacking monster and no others, unless the attacking monster is removed from 
combat. Any monsters that are not dizzy and are not being directly attacked can 
choose to block any monsters that are not directly attacking a 
monster.<BR><BR>

Example: <I>Webrunner has two Winged Demons (50/35) and an NPC 
(0/10). I have a Brick Wall (0/60) and a Stone Golem (45/45). Webrunner has the 
NPC directly attack my Brick Wall, and attacks me with both of the Winged 
Demons. I can not choose to block either of the Winged Demons with my Brick 
Wall, because it is blocking the NPC. My Stone Golem can choose to block either 
of the Winged Demons, since their attack targets me. However, it can not block 
the NPC. If I cast a spell to destroy or dizzy the NPC, then my wall could block 
a Winged Demon.</I><BR><BR>

If your monster attacks your opponent and is not 
blocked, it will deal damage equal to its attack power to your opponent. If your 
monster attacks your opponent and is blocked, half the damage <B>beyond</B> what 
is needed to kill the monster will damage your opponent. Monsters that directly 
attack other monsters will never deal overflow damage.<BR><BR>

Example: <I>In the example above, I choose to block one of the Winged Demons with my Stone Golem. 
The first Winged Demon will deal 50 damage to me. The second will deal 50 damage 
to my Stone Golem; 5 more than enough to kill it, so I will take an extra 2 
damage. Fortunately, my Stone Golem will deal 45 damage to the Winged Demon and 
kill it. Because my Stone Golem is defending, the overflow damage is 
meaningless. I will take a total of 52 damage this round.</I><BR><BR><B>

5.7. <span id=5_7>The Attack Resolution </span><BR></B>This phase <B>will</B> happen 
reguardless of whether or not your opponent attacked. During the Attack 
Resolution phase of your opponent's turn, you are in control of the phase, 
meaning that the phase ends when you are ready.<BR><BR>The Attack Resolution 
phase is basicly a last chance for you to use your monsters' and effects' 
abilities before they undizzy in your draw phase.<BR><BR><B>

6. <span id=6_0>Victory</span><BR></B>There are four ways to win a game: You can beat your 
opponent's life to 0 or below; Your opponent can be forced to draw from a 
depleted deck; Your opponent can <A 
href="#7_0">surrender</A>; You can play a card which has a special win condition; Finally, 
your opponent can time out/disconnect.<BR><BR>It's customary to say "Good Game" 
before dealing the final blow or drawing the last card or such.<BR><BR>When the 
game ends, you will be taken to a splash screen which will display who won as 
well as Whenever you win a game, you get a number of points equal to:<BR>200 + 
(Opponent's Wins) + (Opponent's Losses)/5<BR>To a maximum of 400 points.<BR>When 
you lose, you gain about half the points:<BR>50 + (Opponent's Wins)/2 + 
(Opponent's Losses)/10<BR>To a maximum of 200 points.
<Br><Br>
A note on "decking": It's common to think of Decking as running out of cards.  This, however, is false.  Decking occurs when you try to draw from an empty deck, not if your empty deck is being drawn from.  This distinction is now important with the advent of cards that can draw from your opponent's deck.
<BR><BR><B>
7. <span id=7_0>Chat Commands</span><BR></B>While in the game, there are a few special 
commands you can type.<BR>
<BR><U>/me:</U> Emotes. So typing "/me is the greatest 
player ever." would display "<ACTION>HailSpork is the greatest player 
ever."
<BR><U>/surrender:</U> You lose the game. Please don't type this if the 
person is a turn away from winning. Just let them kill 
you.
<br><U>/loadfix:</u> If the cards don't load right for some reason, try this.
<BR><U>/invisible:</U> If you type this, you will tell your opponent that 
you want to make the game invisible. If your opponent also types this, then your 
game will no longer be open for observation.
<BR><U>/visible:</U> If your game is 
invisible and you type this, your game will once again be open for 
observation.<BR><BR><B>


8. <span id=8_0_0>Avatars</span><BR></B></B>
CMC allows a user to customize an avatar image out of buildable parts.  If your avatar is blank, then you need to build your base avatar.  Simply go to the avatar page to do so.  Once your base avatar data is created, click the bottom link on the avatar page to build your .PNG file.  The avatar system works by building a full png file from your data, and you choose your data.  You can get avatar parts in several ways.  The most common is to buy them from the individual avatar part stores.  NOTE: AT THIS TIME YOU CANNOT SELL AVATAR PARTS.  Each part costs a certian amount of points, and you only ever have to buy a certian part once.  If you try to buy a part you already have you will not be able to buy it.  Avatar parts can be included in Vouchers as well, but they will not indicate if an avatar part actually is included: you will have to check your avatar part sections to see.<br><br>
Please note, Java doesn't 'refresh' images very quickly, so you may not see avatar changes immediately.  Also note, that your avatar hasn't yet changed until you rebuild your avatar file at the bottom of the avatar page.<br><br>
